01. There are n nodes numbered from 0 to n â€“ 1 connected by undirected node-to-node connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between nodes ai and bi. Any node can reach other nodes directly or indirectly through the network.
A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some nodes unable to reach some other nodes.
Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

Input Format: N = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]

Result: [[1, 3]]
